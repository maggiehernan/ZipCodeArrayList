Reflection:
===========
     -- Everything was going well until Thursday
     --I was somewhat understanding everything (had to go to a lot of office hours)
     --After uploading my files to the terminal, I have no idea what happened but VSC told me that it could not find my classes and had preview features enabled at an invalid source level 14.
     --Everything was good when I was working with the TA right before this, and I am not what sure happened. 
     --So I am now unsure of whether or not my code will work because I cannot physically run the program and I don't know how to fix a priview features errors.
     --UPDATE AFTER EXTENSION I had some trouble printing out the latitude and longitude, everything else worked fine but those returned null
     --After doing a lot of debugging, I realized where I was going wrong and was able to get everything I needed.
